# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
This project uses unsupervised learning to perform an analysis on the Cryptocurency exchange for a future offering in a new portolio.  Processing of the data included
preprocessing, clustering, reducing the dimensions and principal components of the source data with PCA.

The output of the analysis will assist in creating report on the cryptocurrencies trading currently and how these can be grouped to create a classification system for the new portolio.
