# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
This project uses unsupervised learning perform an analysis on Cryptocurency exchange for an offerin in the new portolio.  Processing of the data included
preprocessing, clustering, reducing the dimensionand and principal components of the source data with PCA.

The output of the analysis will create a report on the cryptocurrencies trading currently and how these can be grouped to create a classification system for the new portolio.
